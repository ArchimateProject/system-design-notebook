## Server

### What is a server?
A server, similarly to a client, can be a software or hardware, but as opposed to a client, its role is to serve the client. It can be by providing a certain resource to the client or let it use a service that is running on the server.
Few examples:

* A system that stores files and allow the user to access or download them
* A system that runs a service which allows users to listen to music

### Types of servers

## Client

A client refers to a software or hardware accessing a resource or a service that is served by a server.
While in some cases the server and the client might be on the same system/host, in most cases they will be on separate systems.

Examples for clients:

* A Web browser that is used by a user to access a certain web page
* A mobile phone that is used by the user to read emails
