# DNS

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System): "Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols."

In other words, the most common use can of a DNS would be a address translation. It can be from a hostname to IP address and vice versa - from an IP address to a hostname.
In addition, a DNS can be used for load balancing, using the round robin technique.
