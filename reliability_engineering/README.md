# Reliability

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability,_availability_and_serviceability): "Reliability can be defined as the probability that a system will produce correct outputs up to some given time t.[5] Reliability is enhanced by features that help to avoid, detect and repair hardware faults. A reliable system does not silently continue and deliver results that include uncorrected corrupted data."

Question: can you explain the difference between Availability and Reliability?

# Serviceability

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability,_availability_and_serviceability): "Serviceability or maintainability is the simplicity and speed with which a system can be repaired or maintained; if the time to repair a failed system increases, then availability will decrease."

# Availability

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability,_availability_and_serviceability): "Availability means the probability that a system is operational at a given time, i.e. the amount of time a device is actually operating as the percentage of total time it should be operating. High-availability systems may report availability in terms of minutes or hours of downtime per year."

In simpler words, the percentage of time a system, service or app is accessible, operational

# Failover

Failover (or failover strategy) is the process of switching upon a failure from non-operational system (application, storage, DB, ...) to an operational system or a previous operational state of the same system.

It used to be done either automatically or manually. Today, especially in the era of public clouds, this process is often automated.
